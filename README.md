## Installation

### Dependencies

* docker
* docker-compose version >= 1.29

### Building production containers


Go to the `docker` directory and build the containers (this may take several minutes):
```
docker-compose --profile prod build
```

### Initializing databases

The databases need to be initialized, again from the `docker` directory:
```
docker-compose --profile prod up munimap-postgis munimap-postgis-mapbender
```
When the message `database system is ready to accept connections` is displayed the initialization is complete, and the containers can be stopped with `ctrl+c`.

## Start

Go to the `docker` directory and start the application:
```
docker-compose --profile prod up
```
After everything loaded up you can reach the application at `http://localhost`. The admin interface is found under
`http://localhost/admin` and by default the admin user is named `verwalter` and has the password `verwalter`.
