* docker
* docker-compose
* Node (>= 10)
* Python (>=3.9)
* Java 8 (openjdk-8-jre)

  ```

**Note**: Depending on your Python version, it can happen that during the package installation process you come across an error like `lib/hnjmodule.c:3:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory`.
If this shows, you need to install the appropriate dev library for your Python version, for instance `libpython3.9-dev` instead of `libpython3-dev`

## Initial development setup

The following steps are required once:

* Download mapfish

```
cd ../dev/
wget -q -O- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mapfish/print/print-cli/3.9.0/print-cli-3.9.0-tar.tar | tar -x -C ./mapfish
``` 

* Clone and install anol

```
cd ../../
git clone git@github.com:terrestris/anol.git
cd anol/
npm i
```

* Install (and watch) the bielefeldGEOCLIENT frontend

```
cd ../bielefeldGEOCLIENT/
npm i
npm start
```

* Install the munimap backend using a Python 3.9 Virtual Environment

  - Install python 3.9 on your system (Assuming debian based linux distro):
    - If Python3.9 is not available to install on your distro: 
      - `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
      - `sudo apt-get update`
    - Install Python3.9
      - `sudo apt install python3.9`
    - install python3.9 venv
      - `sudo apt install python3.9-venv`
  - create the virtual environment
    - `python3.9 -m venv muni_venv` (or any other name you like)
  - Activate Virtual Environment
    - `source muni_venv/bin/activate`
  - Install requirements:
      ```
      pip3 install wheel setuptools
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      pip3 install -e ../
      pip3 install --no-index -e ../munimap_digitize/
      pip3 install --no-index -e ../munimap_transport/
      ```
  - Install language support
    - `python3.9 -c "import hyphen.dictools; hyphen.dictools.install('de')"`
  - Update translations
    ```
    FLASK_APP=manage.py flask babel-refresh
    FLASK_APP=manage.py flask babel-compile
    ```

## Start the application

After all steps from above have been applied successfully, the application can be started with:
- `FLASK_APP=manage.py flask run-munimap`
  
By default a configuration file located in the `dev/` folder is used. However you can use a custom file by providing `FLASK_MUNIMAP_CONFIG` environment variable:
- `FLASK_APP=manage.py FLASK_MUNIMAP_CONFIG='../path/to/your/custom/config/file.conf' flask run-munimap`

For debugging purposes, you may use the environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG=1` if not set in the configuration file
- `FLASK_DEBUG=1 FLASK_APP=manage.py flask run-munimap`

You can also set the environment your app is running on by setting the `FLASK_ENV=development` environment variable, if not already in the config file
- `FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=manage.py flask run-munimap`

If you want to use mapfish and have not configured Java 8 as the default Java Version, you need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. i.e.:
- `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/ FLASK_APP=manage.py flask run-munimap`

In another terminal the docker dev environment needs to be started
- `docker-compose --profile dev up`

and finally the client (javascript) source can be watched via:
- `npm start` (ran in the root folder, i.e, bielefeldGEOCLIENT)

The application should now be available via [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) (Proxied to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)).

The docs are available via [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/) (Proxied to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000))

Start print queue/broker (**TODO UNTESTED**):
- `python -m munimap.queue.worker -q /tmp/printqueue.sqlite`

If you are running the dev setup and the prod setup after each other it can be that some of the permissions are not fitting. Try
```
sudo chmod -R a+rwx munimap/assets/
sudo chmod -R a+rwx dev/data/
```
**Note**: Other commands are also set in the `manage.py`. You can check which commands exist by running `FLASK_APP=manage.py flask --help`


## Debugging the application

# With VSCODE
A debug configuration is provided and can be found in `.vscode/launch.json`.
If you are using a custom config file for your application, you have to change it's path in `FLASK_MUNIMAP_CONFIG`.
Then all you need to do is start debugging with vscode

# With PyCharm
TODO

## Testing the application

To test the application, you will need to install the requirements defined on `requirements-testing.txt`. To do so, run `pip install -r requirements-testing.txt`. Make sure you are on your virtual environment, altough not mandatory.

You will also need to have created the test database `munimap_test` or any other name, depending on your TestConfig, which is found in: `munimap/config.py`. The structure of the DB must be the same as the regular DB.

Tests run with [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Go to the root level of the application and run `nosetests`
Then, you will be able to run the tests

**TODO**: Make creation and deletion of test DB automatic with test run
**TODO**: Consider migrating tests and fixtures to `pytest` in the future


## About building or generating documentation

If you need to work on changing the documentation, this is done using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

Firts of all, you need to install the requirements defined on `requirements-docs.txt`. To do so, run `pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`. Make sure you are on your virtual environment, altough not mandatory.

A source is already provided and can be found in `munimap-docs` folder (`../docker/munimap-docs/` if you are currently on `dev/`).  

If you make any changes and need to build it for publishing, simply run `sphinx-build`, providing the source folder and an output folder for the built version.

There is no need to create a new source, but if for some reason you need it, you can do so by simply running `sphinx-quickstart` and answer the questions. Alternatively you can also run `sphinx-autogenerate` by providing a source file so it can autogenerate the `rst` files.

You can also generate API docs by running `sphinx-apidocs`.

Check the Sphinx documentation for further information.

**NOTE**: A docker container for the docs is provided. By making changes to the source, a new documentation is automatically compiled from the source. However, you can always execute the container interactively and do your changes there directly or run the already mentioned commands.
